The dancing figure is a rebel, protester, a riot girl, a fighter for freedom. Twelve GIF-animations show twelve different gestures of protest. These gestures were developed by analysing google images from 2014 showing protests all over the globe e.g. in the Ukraine, in Turkey, in Tunisia, or in Egypt. The gesture of protest is reduced to its pure aesthetic and turns from a political act to a performative movement. The visitor of the website can arrange the GIFs within a grid. This s an attempt to explore the relation between the political and the performative. Furthermore it is planned to exhibit this work as an interactive installation which animates visitors to form their own 'rebel army' and compare it to those of other visitors.",

Univ. of California Press, 1984) takes place in the form of murals, tags and graffiti. As part of the public sphere, they are ephemeral and get painted over, crossed out or simply washed away. In addition to those spontaneous manifestations of painted letters, also house numbers, letterings of entrances and advertisements are part of the narrative. This narrative represents a hidden language through which the city speaks for itself.",

I stylized, categorized and organized the urban signs to find physical movements that abstract and still display the icon they derive from. The decoded signs are the alphabet for a performative language that illustrates itself in graphic patterns.
